# Polyglot-CICD-Platform

🚀 A universal **CI/CD platform** designed for **polyglot microservices** using **Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Tekton**.  
Supports Node.js, Python, Java, and can be extended to other languages.

---

## 🌟 Why this project?
- Modern applications use **multiple languages** (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, etc.)
- Companies rely on **different CI/CD systems** (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Tekton)
- Hard to manage **consistency & migration** across pipelines
- 👉 This project solves that with a **standardized polyglot pipeline framework**

---

## 🔧 Features
- ✅ Multi-language build/test (Node, Python, Java)  
- ✅ Docker image build & push (registry-ready)  
- ✅ Works with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Tekton  
- ✅ Change detection → only build changed services  
- ✅ Kubernetes-native pipelines (via Tekton)  
- ✅ Easy migration between CI/CD systems

## ⚙️ CI/CD Tools
- **GitHub Actions** → For modern cloud-native automation  
- **Jenkins** → For enterprise/legacy compatibility  
- **Tekton** → For Kubernetes-native deployments  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Polyglot-CICD-Platform.git

    Add secrets for Docker registry (user/password).

    Push a change in any service → pipeline will detect and run build/test only for that service.

🌍 Real-world Use Cases

    Enterprises with multi-language microservices

    Teams migrating from Jenkins → GitHub Actions / Tekton

    Cloud-native orgs adopting Kubernetes-native CI/CD

    Developers who want one pipeline system for all languages & tools

📌 Next Steps

    Add Go/.NET microservice support

    Integrate Trivy for container scanning

    Add staging → production promotion pipeline

⚡ Is tarah ka README directly aapke repo me powerful impression dalega (portfolio + real-world relevance ke liye).  

👉 Kya aap chahte ho main is README ke liye ek **architecture diagram (Jenkins + GitHub Actions + Tekton + Polyglot services)** bhi bana du?
